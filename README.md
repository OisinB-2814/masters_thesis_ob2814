The topic of energy efficiency is one of the most prevalent topics in our society today. The move towards environmentally friendly practices has seen a dramatic rise in popularity, in both the private and public sectors, as well as within the general public. A variety of approaches have been taken in this regard. Journals published as early as the 1980s have broached different approaches in search of the ideal model. The scope of this topic governs every industry in the world, and is imperative to a sustainable future for humankind. Initially, the studies in this field focused on efforts to improve the efficiency of buildings during their construction period. This has evolved in the age of information through the use of computational models to predict what can impact energy usage in a building, whether it be a school, office or water treatment plant.
